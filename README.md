# MGSC695-Optimization-FinalProject
In this school project, my team and I did an exploration of the elastic net model. We chose a dataset being student grades, and tested Rigde, Lasso and Elastic Net models on this data. We ran two versions of each model: one black-box package and one code from scratch. Results were analyzed at the end.
